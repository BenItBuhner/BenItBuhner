# Bennett Buhner — Building Practical, Agentic AI Systems

I’m an 18 y/o developer focused on scaling agent frameworks, improving model behavior, and pushing generative AI to be *actually* useful. Most of my work centers on long-horizon reasoning, lightweight architectures, and building systems that can take action with minimal overhead. I like moving fast, iterating hard, and building things that actually work in practice, not just in theory.

## What I’m Building Right Now

- **Agent Chassis**  
  A light weight base for anyone to quickly make and scale their own agents. 

- **Athena Model Line**  
  A set of compact and mid-sized models (256M → 14B+) such as Athena 0 Pico, Athena 0 Mini, and Athena 1 Recursive. These explore dense reasoning, TRM-style looping, and long-context performance.

- **Training Pipelines, RL Environmnets, and More**  
  Making environments for training models, exepreimting with looped and recursive pipelines for maximizing small models where we can.

- **Athena Cloud Code**  
  A cloud-based software engineering agent capable of working for extended periods on complex tasks, built off the Base Agent architecture.

## Skill Highlights

### Backend / Infrastructure
- Python, FastAPI, Docker  
- Building OpenAI-style APIs and model proxies  
- Designing agent frameworks that stay clean, reliable, and efficient

### AI / ML
- LLM pretraining
- RL work (RULER-RL, synthetic scaling, and environment creation)  
- TRM experimentation and recursive SLM scaling  
- Practical agent reliability: reducing context bloat, improving tool-call success, building fail-safes

### Design / Frontend
- Figma (especially mobile interface design)  
- Next.js, TypeScript, CSS  
- Creating simple, clean UI/UX flows

## Goals

I want to keep pushing AI toward systems that actually help people get real work done. That includes better reasoning, cleaner architectures, and practical agent behavior. I care a lot about shaving hours down to minutes and building models and frameworks that scale without unnecessary complexity. The aim is simple: make AI faster, more capable, and more intuitive to use.
