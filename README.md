# 🌄 Overview
Hi! I am Bennett Buhner, full time X addict and part time light dev! I love developing with/for AI, training SLMs, and more!

# 🤓 Generative AI
I love to use AI to get montonous tasks done and love scaling AI to its limits even more. I have been working rigorously to make some of the best agentic frameworks out there and to adapt them and make them as efficient as possible whilst maximizing intelligence, alignment, and overall precision. 

# 👨‍💻 Software Engineering
I am relatively proficient at Python... as all my repositories may suggest, and I tend to use the likes of Cursor to curate a good chunk of my diffs now. Overall, I am best able to develop in Python, TypeScript, Tailwind, and more.

# 👤 Design 
I am a design *addict* and enjoy using Figma massively. It only makes it all the better when I can simply use the Figma MCP to port over designs from concept to reality in minutes!

# 🔔 Goals
I aspire to scale to AGI and make universal agentic frameworks that can maximize the usability and autonomy of AI as it stands.
