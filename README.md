# Overview

I am an aspiring 18 y/o, working to get ahead of the rest and scale generative AI far. I love to create agent frameworks, enable AI to take action on behalf of you, and crunch the time it takes to do something from hours or days to minutes. 

# Skill Highlights

- **Python & FastAPI:** I am pretty coherent at these, and have used  them quite a bit lately to create a few OSS  projects that help save time.
- **PyTorch:** I am no "pro" yet per se, but I have been consistenly learning and progressing more through it as time goes on.
- **Desing:** One of my biggest pasttimes has been designing; I generaly use Figma and it is so fun to make clean and inutitive mobile interaces among other unique projects.

# Goals

I want to scale AI farther than ever before. Be that through RL, an entirely new architecture, and/or the most intuitive interfaces possible. I aim for the best experiences that not only help get things done faster, but *also* encourage learning along the way.
